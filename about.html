                </p>
                <p>Harassment is a very broad term which can take many different forms. We focus mainly on the idea of harassment in the workplace which is defined by the belittling or threatening behavior directed at an individual worker or a group of workers. This can take many forms such as verbal, emotional, and physical harassment. Harassment in the workplace can often look harmless and is often not taken seriously regardless of severity. KickHERassMENt's main goal is to change this unforunate truth.</p>

                <p>
                    A survey of women from February 2015 by Cosmopolitan gave the following results:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="stats">One in three women from age 18-34 are sexually harassed at work</li>
                    <li class="stats">16% of women said NO when asked if they had been sexually harassed at work, but said YES to experiencing sexually explicit or sexist remarks.</li>
                    <li class="stats">When asked about reporting sexual harassment, only 29% of women said they reported their experiences while 75% of women did not. Only 15% of these women felt that their situations were handled fairly.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    And of course, the statistics are not only limited to women. A report conducted by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s Select Task Force on the Study of Harassment in the Workplace yielded the following results:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="stats">Nearly one-third of the 90,000 charges of discrimination received by the EEOC last fiscal year included workplace harassment.</li>
                    <li class="stats">While calling this form of harassment “understudied,” the report notes that an alarmingly high number of workers—perhaps up to 60 percent—have experienced race or ethnicity-based harassment at the workplace.</li>
                    <li class="stats">Surveying various studies, the report shows 35 percent of gay and bisexual people who are out at work suffer from harassment.</li>
                    <li class="stats">Up to 58 percent of LGBT people have heard derogatory comments about sexual orientation or gender identity in the workplace.</li>
                    <li class="stats">In one study of LGBT employees, 41 percent of respondents reported being verbally and/or physically abused at work or having their work spaces vandalized.</li>
                    <li class="stats">And yet, despite these bleak numbers, roughly 3 out of 4 individuals who experienced workplace harassment never even talked to a supervisor, manager, or union representative about the illegal conduct.</li>
                </ul>

                </p>
                <p>The best way to increase diversity and avoid harassment in the workplace is to simply be aware. Know what harassment is and what it looks like and make efforts in your establishment to improve the way harassment reports are handled. They should no longer be something that is pushed aside. Use KickHERassMENt to get a vitrual experience of what harassment looks like and hear from real-life victims who can give advice on how their situations could have been handled differently. The difference starts with you!
